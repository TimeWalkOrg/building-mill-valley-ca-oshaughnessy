# The O'Shaughnessy Building
41-67 Throckmorton Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

The O’Shaughnessy Building was constructed and opened in 1907, housing businesses including S. M. Burt Co. hardware store and the Aloha Hotel and restaurant.  The name of the hotel is believed to come from owner Michael Maurice O’Shaughnessy’s connection with Hawaii.  He made several trips to the islands prior to 1907 to work on water projects there. A hotel, operating under multiple names, continued to occupy the upper floor of the building until about 1950. 

A May 1938 photo shows Red Hill Liquors and a Purity Stores market on the ground floor of the building. Red Hill Liquors continued operate until 1977, after which liquors were sold by Don Pozo’s and Vintage Wine & Spirits.  From the 1980s to 2008, a Banana Republic clothing store occupied the space where Purity Stores once was.  The last tenant prior to the recent reconstruction of the O’Shaughnessy Building was a cooking store called Tyler Florence. When renovation began in 2014, Tyler Florence closed and Vintage Wine & Spirits moved to the nearby Keystone Building.

Prior to the 2014-2017 reconstruction, the O’Shaughnessy Building was remodeled or reconstructed on multiple occasions.  The first major change was reconfiguring the front of the building from a three-faceted to a two-faceted design.  This took place sometime between the 1920s and 1938.  A later remodel/reconstruction was circa 2005.
